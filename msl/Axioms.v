(** * Extensionality axioms *)

(** The following [Require Export] gives us functional extensionality for dependent function types:
<<
Axiom functional_extensionality_dep : forall {A} {B : A -> Type},
  forall (f g : forall x : A, B x),
  (forall x, f x = g x) -> f = g.
>>
and, as a corollary, functional extensionality for non-dependent functions:
<<
Lemma functional_extensionality {A B} (f g : A -> B) :
  (forall x, f x = g x) -> f = g.
>>
*)
Require Export Stdlib.Logic.FunctionalExtensionality.

(** For compatibility with earlier developments, [extensionality]
  is an alias for [functional_extensionality]. *)

Lemma extensionality:
  forall (A B: Type) (f g : A -> B),  (forall x, f x = g x) -> f = g.
Proof. intros; apply functional_extensionality. auto. Qed.

Arguments extensionality [A B] _ _ _.

(** We also assert propositional extensionality. *)

Axiom prop_ext: ClassicalFacts.prop_extensionality.
Arguments prop_ext [A B] _.

(** * Proof irrelevance *)

(** We also use proof irrelevance, which is a consequence of propositional
    extensionality. *)

Lemma proof_irr: ClassicalFacts.proof_irrelevance.
Proof.
  exact (ClassicalFacts.ext_prop_dep_proof_irrel_cic prop_ext).
Qed.
Arguments proof_irr [A] _ _.
