READ ME before you read the README.

This file written by Andrew Appel, November 30, 2012.

This directory tree is a subset of the CompCert source tree,
initially taken from the "clightgen" branch at revision 2073.
Basically, it is just enough to build Clight.vo and its dependencies.

Every file in this directory tree is verbatim from CompCert EXCEPT: 
  FIRST_README, Makefile.clight, make, Makefile.config

To build, use ./make, which is just a shell script for
   "make -f Makefile.clight"
