READ ME before you read the README.

This file written by Andrew Appel, November 30, 2012.

This directory tree is a subset of the CompCert source tree,
initially taken from the "clightgen" branch at revision 2073.
Basically, it is just enough to build Clight.vo and its dependencies.

Every file in this directory tree is verbatim from CompCert EXCEPT: 
  FIRST_README, Makefile.clight, make, Makefile.config

To create (or to update when there's a new version of compcert),
  ./GRAB ~/compcert
  (see the Usage instructions at the beginning of the GRAB file)

To build, use ./make, which is just a shell script for
   "make -f Makefile.clight"

NOTE FOR COMPCERT 2.5 RELEASE:
The file exportclight/ExportClight.ml distributed in CompCert 2.5
does not build.  If you install your own CompCert 2.5:
before building clightgen, copy ./exportclight/ExportClight.ml
from this VST release into CompCert/exportclight.
[This should be fixed in CompCert 2.5.1 and later.]
