READ ME before you read the README:
Explanation regarding the VST/compcert directory of
the Verified Software Toolchain project.

This VST/compcert directory tree is a subset of the CompCert source tree.
Basically, it is just enough to build Clight.vo and its dependencies.

Every file in this directory tree is verbatim from CompCert EXCEPT
  the file you are reading, FIRST_README

To create (or to update when there's a new version of compcert),
  ../util/GRAB ~/compcert
  (see the Usage instructions at the beginning of the GRAB file)

To build (this step is now done automatically in VST's main makefile):
   make exportclight/Clightdefs.vo
