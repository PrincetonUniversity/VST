# Catalog of multilevel verified programs
To prove your program correct, prove that the low-level program (such as a C program) correctly implements a functional model, then (separately) prove that the functional model correctly satisfies a high-level specification.

Ideally, many of the following requirements should be satisfied.  Henceforth we will refer to the low-level program as a "C program" but the concept generalizes to Rust, Java, etc.
- **Multilevel:**  The C program must not only be proved to implement a functional model, the functional model must be proved to actually do the desired thing.
Or at least, *High-level:** a high-level correctness property is proved about the C program, without an intermediate functional-model layer.
- **Unified:**  The C-program proof and high-level proof should be done in the same logical framework so that they can be composed into a single, machine-checkable, end-to-end theorem.
- **Composable:** Even if they are not in the same logical framework, the _specification_ of the C-program proof should be able to mention operators from the functional model (function names and other abstractions) so that the low-level and high-level theorems can be composed "on paper".
- **Low-expressive:** The proof system for C-program proofs should be expressive enough to verify "dusty deck" programs that do all-too-clever things with data representations.
- **High-expressive:** The proof system for high-level proofs should be expressive enough to verify high-level specifications with entirely nontrivial application-specific mathematics.
- **Modular or Semimodular:**  The verification should be in a style of "modular verification of modular programs with data abstraction".  In VST (for example) the verification
should be in the form of a [Verified Software Unit (VSU)](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/vc-current/VSU_intro.html).
If not *modular,* then at least,
*semimodular,* meaning that each function is verified w.r.t. its
own function-spec, and the verification of the caller depends only
on the *specification* of the callee, and not on its function-body.
- **Open-source:** The C program and its proofs (low-level and high-level) should be open-source so that people can examine and compare them.
- **Documented:** The verification should be (if possible) documented in a paper so people can understand what it's about.
- **32/64-bit:**  The C program and its proofs are portable to C implementations
with 32-bit pointers or 64-bit pointers.  But not all C programs are portable
in that way, and even where the program is portable, the proof might not be.
Programs/proofs that are not portable are marked here as 32-bit or 64-bit.

Here we provide a catalog of such verifications.  So far, all of these are done with the Verified Software Toolchain, but we welcome examples done with other verifiers
(contribute to this list by pull request).

**If you use a different C program verifier**, these examples provide C program test cases along with specifications and invariants that you may find useful.

### General framework

For each benchmark, we give a brief summary, followed by URLs for,

Where to find it:
- The paper: either a published paper or unpublished documentation explaining the main point.
- C program: link to a .c program in an open-source repository (see the rest of the repo for context).
- Functional model: usually in the form of a functional program in Coq (Gallina), but could in principle be an inductive relation or some other mathematical structure.
- Low-level spec:  Separation logic (or other program logic) specification of how the
variables and data structures of the C program encode the values of the functional model.
- Low-level proof:  Proof in the program logic that the C program correctly implements the functional model.
- High-level spec: Proposition in Coq giving the claimed high-level property of the functional model.
- High-level proof: Proof in Coq that the functional model satisfies the high-level specification.

-----------------------------------------------------

### SHA-256
- Yes:  Low-expressive, Open-source, Documented, 32-bit
- Not: Multilevel or High-level, hence not Unified or High-Expressive

Secure Hash Algorithm from an early release of OpenSSL.
We include this here because it is an important component of HMAC and HMAC-DRBG.
Even though nobody knows how to do the high-level proof (whether in a proof assistant or in just "mathematics") that SHA-256 is collision-resistant, everybody assumes that's true, and based on that assumption one can do high-level proofs (in math or in Coq) of the properties of HMAC and HMAC-DRBG; see below.

*Warning: These proofs are very old (dating originally from 2013), and
therefore clumsy and cumbersome, because they often do not take
advantage of more modern VST-Floyd proof automation.*

### HMAC
- Yes:  Low-expressive, Open-source, Documented, Multilevel, Unified, High-Expressive, 32-bit

Hash-based Message Authentication Code, a keyed cryptographic hash function, from OpenSSL.

**Theorem.** The assembly-language program, resulting
from compiling OpenSSL 0.9.1c using CompCert, correctly implements the FIPS standards for HMAC and
SHA, and implements a cryptographically secure PRF (pseudorandom function)
subject to the usual assumptions about SHA.

### HMAC-DRBG
- Yes:  Low-expressive, Open-source, Documented, Multilevel, Unified, High-Expressive, 32-bit

Widely used cryptographic random number generator standardized by NIST and implemented in mbedTLS open-source library: takes a small sequence of truly random bits and expands to a much longer sequence of hard-to-predict bits.

*Warning: These proofs are very old (dating originally from 2016),
done by a novice VST user, 
 and are therefore clumsy and cumbersome, because they often do not take
advantage of more modern VST-Floyd proof automation.*

**Theorem.**
1.  Verson 2.1.1 of the mbedTLS
HMAC-DRBG correctly implements the NIST 800-90A standard, and
2. HMAC-DRBG Generate and Update as described in that same NIST
800-90A standard *indeed produces pseudorandom output,* subject to
the standard assumptions about SHA-2, as well as certain assumptions about the adversary and the HMAC-DRBG instantiation that
we state formally and explicitly.
3. An adversary with a thousand million terabytes (< 2^78 bits), 
and a million 1-gigahertz processors running for a year (< 2^78 cycles) has a 
0.5+2^(âˆ’52) chance of predicting the next bit.
