(*  EXAMPLES OF USE

Parameter environ : Type.

Canonical Structure LiftEnviron := Tend environ.

Definition foo (v : nat) := (v=O).
Check (`foo).
Check (`(fun v => v=O)).

(* Infix "-.>" := Tarrow (at level 80, right associativity).  (* The
      only purpose of this Infix is to make the error message slightly prettier,
      but they're not bad even without it. *) *)
(* Notation  "x '-.>[' y ] " := (Tarrow x (LiftEnviron y)) (at level 80, right associativity).  *)


Check `plus.
Check (`(plus 4)).

(* Goal (lifted (nat -.> (nat -.> LiftEnviron nat)) = ((environ -> nat) -> (environ -> nat) -> (environ -> nat))).
reflexivity.
Qed.
*)

Parameter f: environ -> nat.
Check (`plus f).
Check (`plus f f).
Check (`(@cons nat)).
Check (`(@cons nat) (`plus f f) `nil).
Check (`(@cons _) (`plus f f) `nil).     (* HA!  This line would not have worked using typeclasses for Lift;
            it does work using canonical structures *)
(* Check (`cons (`plus f f) `nil).     (* this line fails, which is OK; however, using the old 'coerce' appoach,
                                                           this would have worked.  *) *)


Example test_plus (s : environ) : (`plus `(4) `3) s = (`(7)) s.
  simpl.  (* doesn't unfold the backtick; this is a good thing, I think. *)
 unfold_lift. (* optional -- proof works with or without it *)
  reflexivity.
Qed.

Example test_plus' (s : environ) : (`plus `(4) `3) s = (`(7)) s.
  simpl.  (* doesn't unfold the backtick; this is a good thing, I think. *)

Definition natfun := nat -> nat.
Opaque natfun.

Definition add : nat -> natfun := plus.

Goal forall rho, `add `(3) rho = (fun y => plus 3 y).
 intro rho.
 simpl.  (* doesn't unfold the backtick; this is a good thing, I think. *)

(* Goal `add `3 = `plus `3.   (* This fails.  Indeed, it should fail.
       But the error message is reasonably informative! *)  *)
